CesiumWidget
===============================

This is an attempt to make a Cesiumjs http://cesiumjs.org/ world globe widget for the IPython (jupyter) notebook.


For license on Cesiumjs see http://cesiumjs.org/index.html

CesiumWidget part of code is under Apache license

Features
--------
Right now the widget doesn't work and is in development. Currently this is more a proof-of-concept. All help welcome :)

The vision is to have the Cesium viewer as a dynamic widget in the IPython notebook
http://cesiumjs.org/Cesium/Build/Apps/CesiumViewer/index.html

This would for example enable:
* 4-D visualization of satellite orbits
* Interface with czml
* Direct interface accessing javascript methods?
* Numpy-like interface to quickly plot stuff
* GeoJSON mapping
* ...
